# PowerBI_DailySalesDashboard

This project is a **Sales Dashboard** for an e-commerce store. The dashboard provides an overview of key metrics and insights derived from sales data, such as total sales, profits, and sales quantities across different categories, states, and payment modes. It is built to visualize trends and help in decision-making by identifying top customers, sales categories, and monthly profit.

## Features

### Key Metrics:
- **Total Sales**: Displays the sum of the total amount generated by the store.
- **Total Profit**: Summarizes the store's profit over a period.
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**: The average amount spent per order.
- **Total Quantity Sold**: The total number of items sold.

### Visualizations:
- **Sales by State**: A bar chart showing the sum of the amount generated by different states.
- **Profit by Month**: A column chart to track profit trends across the year.
- **Sales by Category**: A pie chart representing the quantity sold in various categories like electronics, clothing, and furniture.
- **Payment Mode Distribution**: A pie chart showing the percentage of sales completed by different payment methods.
- **Sales by Customer Name**: A bar chart showing the top customers based on their purchase amounts.
- **Profit by Sub-Category**: A bar chart visualizing the sub-categories that contribute most to the storeâ€™s profit.

1. **Orders Table**: Contains details of each order placed in the store, including order ID, customer ID, product details, quantity, price, and payment method.
2. **Other Details Table**: Includes supporting data like customer names, product categories, state information, and sub-category details.
